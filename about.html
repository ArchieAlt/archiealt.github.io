	<h1 style="float:center">About Me</h1>
	<p>This page Will talk about me</p>
	<p>I am Archie , I am the owner of the site and I fully made it by myself :O</p>
	<h2>Who are you</h2>
	<p>I am a 14 year old boy from Eastern Europe who is VERY interested in IT and computing and stuff.</p>
	<p>I also speak 3 languages ( Bosnian , English and German) , so feel free to email me in German or in Bosnian . </p>
	<p>I have used computers since I was 3 and I started learning programming at 12.If you want to learn more please contact me using the mail provided on the <a href="contact.html">Contacts</a> page !</p>
	<p>I am currently learning C and C++ with HTML . </p>
	<h2>Your specs ?</h2>
	<p>I got <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/list/wRMjDZ">This PC</a> last year around May , but you don't need all of this to learn either programming or some other things !</p>
	<p>I actually used a Core 2 Duo MacBook (which was older than me lol) to learn Python and start my journey in programming !</p>
	<p>I don't really recommend using a Core 2 Duo laptop to learn programming in 2024 unless you want to suffer.You can , but be advised that its really slow and it's better to get more recent hardware !</p>
	<h2>Your interests ?</h2>
	<p>Well I really like Computers and programming(duh) , but I also like small electronics and I want to be an Electrical Engineer !</p>
	<p>This isn't my only hobby since I also like D&D and cars , specifically formula 1 cars and european cars :) </p>
	<p>I also like Music and I play guitar , my favourite genres are Metal and Hip Hop 8) </p>
