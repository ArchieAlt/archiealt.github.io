        <p>Hello, This is my Page that I will be hosting on the internet.</p>
        <p>This site was made using my own HTML skills and GitHub Pages, if you want to make your own website like this one go to my <a href="how.html">how it's made</a> page.</p>
        <p>If you want to learn more about me, you can read it <a href="about.html">here</a> or contact me. For contacts, just go to <a href="contact.html">this</a> page.</p>
        <p>Anyways, you might wonder why this site looks like it came straight from the early 2000s or late 90s, that is my personal choice since I like the aesthetic :)</p>
        <p>At some point, I will start doing tutorials for this site, but for now, I will only recommend some tutorial sites. More on those at <a href="how.html">How It's made</a>.</p>
