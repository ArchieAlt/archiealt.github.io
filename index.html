	<h1>Main Page</h1>
	<p>Hello This is my Page that I will be hosting on the internet.</p>
	<p>This site was made using my own html skills and GitHub Pages , if you want to make your own website like this one go to my <a href="how.html"> how it's made</a> page</p>
	<p>If you want to learn more about me you can read it <a href="about.html">here</a> or contact me , for contacts just go to <a href="contact.html">this</a> page</p>
	<p>Anyways , you might wonder why this site looks like it came out straight from the early 2000s or late 90s , that is my personal choice since I like the asthetic :) </p>
	<p>At some point I will start doing tutorials for this site but for now I will only recommend some tutorial sites , more on those at <a href="how.html"> How It's made</a></p>
