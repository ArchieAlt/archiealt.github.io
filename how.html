	<h1>How I made this site</h1>
	<p>Here I will be explaining the tools and programs I used to make this site !</p>
	<h2>Do you know HTML ?</h2>
	<p>If you want to make a site like this you might first wonder , how ? Well its pretty simple , if you are interested in making a site first of all you will need some HTML code ! </p>
	<p>You might've been turned away from making your own site because of this fact but it's really easy ! I will not teach you how to make your site (yet...) but I recommend watching a couple HTML tutorials on YouTube or on a learning side like FreeCodeCamp !</p>
	<p>Now you may think it's hard but don't think that ! You can do it , if a 14 year old can :) </p>
